# Virtual Reality Car Showroom
Car companies and dealerships alike are adapting to the ubiquity of e-commerce by providing virtual interactions to help customers make buying decisions. VR showrooms allow potential car buyers to experience a more immersive, branded interface with a dealership as opposed to a simple online order. Elements like the multi-angle view of different car models and the branding statement of the interior design can add to the buyer experience and heavily influence purchasing decisions. Consumers can also virtually test drive the vehicle, all from the convenience and speed of a smartphone. A view of the interior, a sense of how the car relates to its surroundings, a “testing” of the controls — this immersive experience gives prospective buyers the opportunity to get acclimated with the car without having to even step foot in a dealership.

Our aim is to create a simple VR showroom that houses automobiles and allows the user to change the body colour of the vehicle, as well as navigate into the interiors of each vehicle.
